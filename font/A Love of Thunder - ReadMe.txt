A LOVE OF THUNDER
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

This one doesn't have a complicated origin story. I love the warm stressing on my "Dirty Headline" font, and I wanted to create a brother-font for it; similarly stressed but with an alternate style, for some mixed graphics. For the base forms, I went to one of my favorite fonts from the 1920s, and dipped it in the same acid-pit (or rather, a very similar one) as DH. The main differences are less stressing on the outlines, a bit more texture and "resolution," and less vertical precision; this one hangs looser on the baseline. Other than that, A LOVE OF THUNDER is a full-keyboard small-caps set with one or two of the usual extras. Enjoy!
